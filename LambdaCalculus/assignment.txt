Part 1

Question 1
kons = λ a d z . z false a d
In Lambda Calc this means:
λ a . (λ d .(λ z . ((z false) a) d))
Kons creates a list in the order of {z false, a}, for example we can set z as 2 and a as 3 and it returns the following:
(λa.(λd.(2 3)))

Question 2
kar = λ p . p (λ n a d . a)
Kar here takes in a list {a,d} and returns the first thing in the list, a.

Question 3
kdr = λ p . p (λ n a d . d)
Kdr here takes in a list {a,d} and returns everything but the first thing in the list, d.

Question 4
null = λ z . z true false false
Null takes in a list, z , and checks to see if it's empty.
